### 📌 Project Overview  

This project demonstrates how to build a **streaming analytics pipeline** using **Apache Kafka**, **Python**, and a **relational database (SQLite)** for data storage. It simulates real-time data generation, ingestion, and processing while storing processed data in a structured database for further analysis and integration with BI tools.

# 🌊 Rafting Feedback Streaming Project

This project is designed to **stream, process, and analyze real-time customer feedback** from rafting trips on the **French Broad River, NC**, using **Apache Kafka**. It integrates customer reviews with **weather and river flow conditions**, providing valuable insights into trip experiences and environmental impacts.

---

### ⚠️ Note: ⚠️
The data in this project is **fictitious** with the use of  **Generative AI (GenAI)** assistants to **generate, problem-solve, and debug** the process.

---

### 🎯 Goals  
- **Real-time processing** of structured (CSV) and semi-structured (JSON) data.  
- **Automated enrichment** of feedback with weather and river conditions.  
- **Performance tracking** for rafting guides based on customer reviews.  
- **Predictive insights** into trip satisfaction and environmental impact.  

### 🚣 Data Sources  
- **Customer Feedback**: Reviews from rafting trip participants.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.  
- **River Flow Levels**: Water level, current speed, and temperature.  

### ⚡ Technologies Used  
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time message streaming and processing.  
- **Python**: Data generation, transformation, and analytics.  
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.  
- **Loguru**: Logging feedback and performance.  
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization for performance trends.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **VS Code**: Development environment.  
- **SQLite**: Relational database for storing processed data.  

### 🔑 Key Features  
- **Real-time data ingestion** from a Kafka topic or a live data file.  
- **Data storage and processing** in SQLite, demonstrating integration with relational databases.  
- **Multiple consumer options**: File-based consumer for testing or Kafka-based consumer for real-time processing.  

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Requirements

### ✅ Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Kafka & Zookeeper** installed and running.
    - bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    - bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
  - **Virtual Environment** set up for dependency management.

### 📥 Installation and Setup

1. Clone the project:
   
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   
3. Install dependencies:
  
4. Set up Kafka and Zookeeper:
   Follow the instructions in [Kafka Install Guide](Jballard_docs/kafka-install-guide.md).

5. Configure environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   ZOOKEEPER_ADDRESS=172.30.179.152:2181
   KAFKA_BROKER_ADDRESS=172.30.179.152:9092
   KAFKA_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30000
   RAFTING_TOPIC=rafting_feedback
   RAFTING_INTERVAL_SECONDS=2
   ```

## 🔹 Project Components

### 1. Data Generation
- **Weather Data** (`utils_generate_weather_data.py`): Generates synthetic weather data for the rafting region.
- **River Flow Data** (`utils_generate_river_flow.py`): Creates realistic river flow conditions.
- **Rafting Feedback** (`utils_generate_rafting_data.py`): Produces customer reviews with a mix of positive and negative feedback.

### 2. Kafka Producers and Consumers
- **Rafting Producer (`rafting_producer.py`)**: Streams generated feedback data to the `rafting_feedback` topic.
- **JSON Consumer (`rafting_consumer.py`)**: Logs all feedback, flags negative comments, and enriches messages with weather and river data.
- **CSV Consumer (`csv_rafting_consumer.py`)**: Processes JSON feedback and republishes it as CSV-friendly structured data.
- **CSV Feedback Consumer (`csv_feedback_consumer.py`)**: Writes structured feedback to a CSV file for analysis.
- **Processed CSV Producer (`csv_rafting_producer.py`)**: Enhances and republishes CSV feedback with status flags and trip disruption alerts.

### 3. Visualization
- **Real-Time Feedback Charts (`jb_project_consumer.py`)**:
  - Positive vs. Negative feedback.
  - Weekly performance trends.
  - Weather impact on feedback.
  - River flow and feedback correlation.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Generation**: Run `rafting_producer.py` to generate and stream rafting feedback.
2. **Real-Time Feedback Processing**: Consumers enrich, log, and publish processed feedback.
3. **Visualization**: `jb_project_consumer.py` updates charts every 10 messages.

## 📊 Visualizations

- **Positive vs. Negative Feedback (Bar Chart)** 
- **Weekly Feedback Trends (Line Chart)**
- **Weather vs. Negative Feedback (Bar Chart)**
- **River Flow vs. Feedback Type (Box Plot)**
